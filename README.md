In this notebook you will find a use case of Chains with the framework Langchain. For this, i created a Pokedex: a virtual assistant using LLM models, able to help pokemon trainers to get information about pokemon and types, using the [Pokemon API](https://beta.pokeapi.co/graphql/console/) with GraphQL as the information source. This notebook is divided in 4 sections:

**NOTE**
This is a simple example of the use of Chains with langchain, applied to a virtual assistant. I simplified the solution to work with specific type of question, so i'm not considering any data validation in the process. **This notebook should not be considered a complete solution for a virtual assistant** The main intention of this notebook is to give an overview of how can use LLM applied to different tasks, and how to use Langchain Chains to concatenate tasks.
